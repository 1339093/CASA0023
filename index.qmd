This is a study note about **CASA0023** Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments

In this note, I will record my weekly study notes and contents weekly.

I believe this <span class="text-green">book</span> can clearly show my learning results. 
It may not be **perfect**, but it also represents my efforts.

**My goal** is to present my own notes while being as interesting as possible and, of course, easy to understand.
This is not only for better <span class="text-red">review</span>, but also for people who have no contact with the field at all to understand and become interested.
