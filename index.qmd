This is a study note about **CASA0023** Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments

In this note, I will record my weekly study notes and contents weekly.

I believe this [book]{.text-green} can clearly show my learning results. It may not be **perfect**, but it also represents my efforts.

**My goal** is to present my own notes while being as interesting as possible and, of course, easy to understand. This is not only for better [review]{.text-red}, but also for people who have no contact with the field at all to understand and become interested.
