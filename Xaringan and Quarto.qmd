title: "Week 2 Xaringan and Quarto"
---

## Xaringan

Xaringan is a new way of doing Slides, much simpler and more straightforward, implemented in R Markdown.
Xaringan overrides all the functionality of regular Slides and provides some additional functionality.
For example: directly implant code, forms, etc

I'll show you my use of Xaringan in the next section(3.2)

## Use of Xaringan

<iframe src="week2/week2.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

In Slide, I recorded what I learned about Xaringan this week, as well as some of my own development.
However, the direct display of Slide does not seem to show the results of images and code blocks directly.


## Quarto

Quarto itself supports building slideshows similar to Xaringan.
Below here I will show the Slide with the image and code that is not clearly shown above.

**Import pictures and table ~**

<div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1em;">
  ![](week2/coding.jpeg){width="100%"}
</div>

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
  This is the description of the image, aligned to the right of the picture.
</div>



<div style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1em;">
**View the head of iris data** (in bold)
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

</div>
