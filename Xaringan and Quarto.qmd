## Summary

Xaringan is a new way of doing Slides, much simpler and more straightforward, implemented in R Markdown. Xaringan overrides all the functionality of regular Slides and provides some additional functionality. For example: directly implant code, forms, etc

I'll show you my use of Xaringan in the next section(3.2)

Quarto itself supports building slideshows similar to Xaringan. Below here I will show the Slide with the image and code that is not clearly shown above.

## Reflection

The things we learnt this week are very effective in academic research and technical presentations; Xaringan can be used to make clear and concise academic presentations and Quarto is good for writing technical documentation or online books. With GitHub Pages, these resources can be easily shared with others.

In the literature, many studies have used Xaringan and Quarto to present data analysis results or technical methods. For example, some studies have used Quarto to write data analysis reports and then publish them as online books that readers can browse interactively.

However, there are some limitations to these tools, such as lack of support for complex formats and the need for some programming skills to use them well.

**ðŸ’¡:**

Quarto's support for multiple languages feels like it would be useful in interdisciplinary research, but in practice, how do you make sure that blocks of code in different languages fit together seamlessly and display correctly? For example, combining data analysis in R with machine learning models in Python.

ï¼ˆPossibly via the Jupyter Kernel, or some package that supports interconnections (reticulate)?ï¼‰

## Application

### Use of Xaringan

In Slide, I recorded what I learned about Xaringan this week, as well as some of my own development. However, the direct display of Slide does not seem to show the results of images and code blocks directly.

### Use of Quarto

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Import pictures and table \~**

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1em;"}
![](week2/coding.jpeg){width="100%"}
:::

::: {style="overflow: hidden;"}

::: {style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1em;"}
**View the head of iris data** (in bold)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```
