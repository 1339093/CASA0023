## Summary

This week's assignment was based around a city case study, combining remote sensing data and policy objectives to analyse the relationship between them. I chose Singapore because it is a highly urbanised island nation that faces a number of climate and environmental challenges, such as rising sea levels, urban heat island effect, and land resource constraints. To address these issues, the Singapore government has developed the Singapore Master Plan (SMP), one of the key objectives of which is to promote sustainable urban development.

In this process, remote sensing data can play a big role, such as monitoring urban sprawl, evaluating green space coverage, and analysing changes in the coastline. Although I seldom pay attention to these ‘macro’ issues in my daily life, this assignment made me realise that satellite data are actually closely related to our urban life and can even influence the government's decisions.

## Application

How exactly can remote sensing data help Singapore's sustainable development goals?

Google Earth Engine provides free Landsat and Sentinel data that researchers can use to analyse urban sprawl.

After looking up the information, I think it can be used in the following ways:

*1. Monitoring urban sprawl*

Singapore's land is very limited, and urbanisation and development can affect natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands and even coastlines. I found that these changes can be analysed using **Landsat** multi-temporal imagery to see just how much urbanisation is affecting the environment. For example, the government can use this data to decide which areas need ecological protection and which can be used for development.

*2. Assessing urban greenery and the heat island effect*

Walking on a concrete road in summer, you can really feel the temperature much higher than in a park, which is the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI). Through the **NDVI (Normalised Vegetation Index)**, we can see the green coverage of Singapore and identify areas with less vegetation and higher temperatures. In this way, the government can target more green spaces, such as planting more trees and promoting rooftop greening, to lower the temperature.

*3. Monitoring Sea Level Rise*

As an island nation, Singapore's coastline will be affected by climate change. Changes in the coastline can be analysed using **Sentinel-1 SAR** data to see which areas may be threatened by sea level rise. This will enable the government to plan ahead, such as reinforcing seawalls and protecting mangroves, which are natural protective barriers.

## Reflection

*1. Remote sensing data is useful but has its limitations.*

I thought that remote sensing data is ‘real time’, but in fact it is affected by weather, data update frequency and other factors, sometimes it may not reflect the latest situation immediately. For example, optical remote sensing (Landsat, Sentinel-2) is difficult to use in cloudy weather, which made me realise why **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** is so important because it is not affected by weather. There is also the fact that data processing is not simple, and after the government acquires the data, it needs professionals to analyse and interpret it before it can really be used for decision making.

*2. The Power of Remote Sensing Data*

This assignment really made me realise that data can shape a city. Government decisions are not made out of thin air, but are based on a variety of data, such as remote sensing imagery, ground measurements, and even social data. It's like Singapore's master plan is not decided arbitrarily, but through data analysis and trend prediction to find the most reasonable development direction. For example, they use remote sensing to monitor the green coverage rate and find areas where parks need to be added; they use coastline data to predict sea level rise and decide where seawalls need to be built. This makes me think that urban planning is actually a kind of ‘data-driven art’.

*3. Human-centred*

This assignment made me think that although data and technology are important, they ultimately serve people. The government can use remote sensing data to optimise urban planning, but if people are not willing to change their habits, it may be difficult to implement policies.

But if ordinary people are allowed to have access to this data, will it lead to better decision-making?

If everyone can view the greening rate and heat island effect index of their neighbourhood through Google Earth Engine as such, this can raise public awareness of environmental protection. If these data are more transparent, citizens may be more willing to participate in urban planning rather than just passively accepting policies.
